                <p>Across the border they turn Water into wine Some say it’s the devil’s blood
                    They’re squeezing from the vine Some say it’s a saviour In these hard and
                    desperate times See, its helps me to forget That we’re just born to die</p>
                <p>I came here like so many did To find the better life To find my piece of easy
                    street To finally be alive And I know nothing good comes easy All good things
                    take some time I made my bed I lie in it To die in it’s the crime</p>
                <p>You can’t help but prosper When the street are paved with gold They say the
                    oil wells ran deeper here Than anybody’s known I packed up on my wife and kid
                    And left them back at home Now there’s nothing in this paydirt The ghost are all
                    I know</p>
                <p>Now the oil’s gone The money’s gone And the jobs are gone Still we’re hangin’ on</p>
                <p>Down in dry county They’re swimming in the sand Praying for some holy water
                    To wash the sins from off our hands Here in dry county The promise has run dry
                    Where nobody cries And no one’s getting out of here alive</p>
                <p>In the blessed name of Jesus I heard a preacher say That we are God’s
                    children And that he’d be back someday And I hoped that he knew Something as he
                    drank his cup of wine I didn’t have too good of a feeling As I head out to the
                    night</p>
                <p>I cursed the sky to open I begged the clouds for rain I prayed to God for
                    water For this burning in my veins It was like my soul’s on fire And I had to
                    watch the flames All my dreams went up in ashes And my future blew away</p>
                <p>Now the oil’s gone The money’s gone And the jobs are gone Still we’re hangin’ on</p>
                <p>Down in dry county They’re swimming in the sand Praying for some holy water
                    To wash the sins from off our hands Here in dry county The promise has run dry
                    Where nobody cries And no one’s getting out of here alive</p>
                <p>Men spend their whole lives Waiting praying for their big reward But it seems
                    sometimes The payoff leaves you feeling Like a dirty whore If I could choose the
                    way I’ll die Make it by the gun or knife ‘Cause the other way there’s too much
                    pain night after night after night…</p>
